GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets developer team to work together on projects.

GitHub essentials are:
1.Repositories
2.Branches
3.Commits
4.Pull Requests
5.Git (the version control software GitHub is built on)

1.Repository
* A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.
* It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).
* It should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.
* It can also be used to store any resources or data that we want to share.

2.Branch
* A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time.
* Master branch is the default branch in repository.
* New Branches are to work separate from the master branch. When code is ready, they can be merged into the master branch.
  If we make changes to the master br  anch while working on a new branch, these updates can be pulled in.

3.Commits
  In GitHub, changes are called commits.
  Each commit (change) has a description explaining in commit message with set of rules called Semantic Versioning.

4.Pull Requests
  Pull Requests are key actions of GitHub collaboration.With a pull request we are requesting that our changes should be
  merged (pulled in) with the master. Pull requests show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in green & red colors.
  After we commit, we can create a pull request and start a discussion, before the code is merged to make correcttions if suggested by collabrator.

5.Git
  Git is CLI a tool to communicate with Github from local syaytem.
